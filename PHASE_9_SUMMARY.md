## 🔗 Integration Points

### QtPyVCP Framework
- Proper widget plugin registration
- Signal/slot architecture for component communication
- Compatible with existing VCP design patterns

### Existing Systems
- Touch configuration system integration
- File browser network share support
- Support bundle compatibility
- Theme system integration

### File Browser Integration
```python
# Network shares appear as file browser roots
network_manager.share_mounted.connect(file_browser.add_root)
network_manager.share_unmounted.connect(file_browser.remove_root)
```

### Application Settings
```python
# Settings changes apply immediately
settings_manager.theme_changed.connect(application.apply_theme)
settings_manager.units_changed.connect(application.update_units)
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Create and Switch Profile
```python
profile_manager = ProfileManager()
profile_data = {
    'name': 'MyMachine',
    'description': 'Custom 3-axis mill',
    'template': 'Basic Sim (3-axis mill)'
}
profile_manager.create_profile_bundle(profile_data)
profile_manager.switch_profile()  # Triggers application restart
```

### Configure Network Share
```python
network_manager = NetworkManager()
share_config = {
    'name': 'Workshop Files',
    'type': 'SMB',
    'server': '192.168.1.100',
    'share': 'shared',
    'mount_point': '/home/user/mnt/workshop'
}
network_manager.mount_share(share_config)
```

### Create System Backup
```python
backup_restore = BackupRestore()
backup_restore.create_backup(
    backup_path='/backups/full_system.zip',
    include_profiles=True,
    include_settings=True,
    include_network=True
)
```
