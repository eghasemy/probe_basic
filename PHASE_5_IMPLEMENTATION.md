# Phase 5 ATC Management - Implementation Complete

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### Overview

Phase 5 ATC Management has been successfully implemented, adding comprehensive ATC state management, M6 remap UI integration, and recovery wizard functionality to the existing Probe Basic system.

### Features Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced ATC Widget (src/widgets/atc_widget/atc.py & atc.qml)

**State Management:**
- ATC state tracking: Ready/Busy/Fault
- Individual pocket state tracking: empty/tool#/fault  
- Interlock status monitoring: door/air/encoder
- Real-time progress tracking during tool changes

**UI Enhancements:**
- State panel showing ATC status and interlocks
- Visual fault indicators on pockets (red highlighting)
- Progress bar during tool change operations
- Colored status indicators (green/yellow/red)

**New Signals Added:**
- `atcStateSig` - ATC state updates
- `pocketStateSig` - Individual pocket state changes
- `interlockSig` - Door/air/encoder status
- `progressSig` - Tool change progress updates

#### 2. M6 Remap Integration

**Sample M6 Remap (configs/atc_sim/macros_sim/atc_change.ngc):**
- Reference implementation as mentioned in issue
- Progress tracking with UI updates
- Interlock checking before tool change
- Step-by-step progress reporting
- Fault handling with state updates

**Enhanced Existing Toolchange (configs/atc_sim/macros_sim/toolchange.ngc):**
- Added Phase 5 progress tracking
- UI state updates throughout process
- Fault reporting integration
- Step logging for better visibility

#### 3. ATC Recovery Wizard (src/widgets/atc_widget/atc_recovery.py & atc_recovery.qml)

**Recovery Functions:**
- Resume mid-change operations
- ATC homing functionality  
- Manual jog to specific pocket
- Clear fault states
- Return to Ready state

**User Interface:**
- Guided recovery process
- Progress tracking during recovery
- Manual pocket selection (1-12)
- Visual status indicators
- Step-by-step instructions

### Integration Points

**LinuxCNC Integration:**
- DEBUG statements in NGC files communicate with UI widgets
- Uses existing parameter system for state persistence
- Compatible with current remap infrastructure

**UI Communication:**
- `(DEBUG, EVAL[vcp.getWidget{"dynatc"}.set_atc_state{"Busy"}])`
- `(DEBUG, EVAL[vcp.getWidget{"dynatc"}.set_progress{"Moving...", 50}])`
- Real-time updates during tool change process

### Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ **ATC state panel; pocket status; door/air checks:**
- State panel shows Ready/Busy/Fault status
- Individual pocket states tracked and visualized
- Door/air/encoder interlock status displayed

✅ **M6 remap sample (remap=M6 ... ngc=atc_change):**
- Created atc_change.ngc as reference implementation
- Shows proper remap structure and UI integration
- Includes progress tracking and fault handling

✅ **Recovery: resume mid-change; home ATC:**
- Recovery wizard provides all required functions
- Resume mid-change capability implemented
- ATC homing functionality available
- Manual jog to pocket for troubleshooting

✅ **Sim ATC changes tools on M6; pocket map and pins track state:**
- Enhanced toolchange.ngc updates UI during execution
- Pocket map shows real-time tool placement
- State tracking throughout tool change process

### Files Modified/Created

**Enhanced Existing Files:**
- `src/widgets/atc_widget/atc.py` - Added state management
- `src/widgets/atc_widget/atc.qml` - Added state UI panel
- `configs/atc_sim/macros_sim/toolchange.ngc` - Added progress tracking

**New Files Created:**
- `configs/atc_sim/macros_sim/atc_change.ngc` - Sample M6 remap
- `src/widgets/atc_widget/atc_recovery.py` - Recovery wizard backend
- `src/widgets/atc_widget/atc_recovery.qml` - Recovery wizard UI
- `src/widgets/atc_widget/__init__.py` - Updated exports

**Testing Files:**
- `test_phase5_atc.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- `verify_phase5.py` - Code verification tool

### Minimal Changes Approach

The implementation follows a minimal changes approach by:
- Enhancing existing ATC widget rather than replacing it
- Adding to existing toolchange.ngc rather than rewriting
- Using existing LinuxCNC remap infrastructure
- Maintaining backward compatibility
- Building on Phase 4 patterns and architecture

### Usage

**For Developers:**
1. Import enhanced ATC widget: `from widgets.atc_widget import DynATC, ATCRecovery`
2. Use in UI layouts alongside existing widgets
3. NGC macros automatically update UI during tool changes

**For Users:**
1. ATC state panel shows current status and interlocks
2. Progress bar appears during tool changes
3. Fault states highlighted in red on pocket map
4. Recovery wizard available for troubleshooting

**Configuration:**
- Existing INI file settings still apply
- No additional configuration required
- Compatible with both carousel and rack ATC setups

### Next Steps

Phase 5 ATC Management is complete and ready for integration into the main PB-Touch application. The implementation provides:
- Comprehensive ATC state management
- Visual progress feedback during tool changes  
- Professional recovery and troubleshooting tools
- Full backward compatibility with existing systems

The foundation is now in place for Phase 6 - Job Manager, File Browser & Conversational programming features.
