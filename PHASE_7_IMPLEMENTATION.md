- **Features**:
  - **Multiple Programs**: Quick (2min), Standard (5min), Thorough (10min) warmup sequences
  - **RPM Ladder**: Graduated speed increases with appropriate dwell times
  - **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bars for overall sequence and current step
  - **Spindle Hours Logging**: Automatic tracking of total and session spindle runtime
  - **Persistent Storage**: JSON-based spindle hours data with backup/recovery
  - **Safety Integration**: Proper start/stop sequencing with LinuxCNC integration points
  - **NGC Script Support**: Companion NGC files for LinuxCNC-native warmup execution
- **Warmup Sequences**:
  - Quick: 500→1000→2000 RPM over 2 minutes
  - Standard: 300→600→1000→1500→2000 RPM over 5 minutes  
  - Thorough: 200→500→800→1200→1800 RPM over 10 minutes

### 4. Maintenance Reminders (`src/widgets/maintenance_reminders/`)
- **Purpose**: Hours-based maintenance alerts with snooze/reschedule capabilities
- **Features**:
  - **Predefined Tasks**: Comprehensive maintenance schedule (spindle lubrication, way maintenance, coolant service, etc.)
  - **Hours-based Tracking**: Maintenance intervals based on actual machine runtime
  - **Priority Levels**: Critical, High, Normal, Low urgency classification
  - **Visual Alerts**: Color-coded status indicators (red=overdue, orange=due soon, green=OK)
  - **Detailed Checklists**: Step-by-step maintenance procedures for each task
  - **Snooze Functionality**: 1 hour to 1 week snooze options with reason tracking
  - **Task Completion**: Mark tasks complete to reset counters and update history
  - **Management Dialog**: Comprehensive view of all maintenance tasks and status
- **Default Maintenance Schedule**:
  - Spindle Lubrication: Every 100 hours
  - Way Lubrication: Every 50 hours
  - Coolant System Service: Every 200 hours
  - Spindle Inspection: Every 500 hours (high priority)
  - Drive Belt Inspection: Every 150 hours (low priority)

### 5. Phase 7 Integration (`src/widgets/phase7_integration.py`)
- **Purpose**: Centralized safety coordination between all Phase 7 components
- **Features**:
  - **Safety Manager**: Coordinates homing, limits, warmup, and maintenance systems
  - **Operation Gating**: Pre-operation checks for jogging and program execution
  - **Signal Coordination**: Connects component signals for unified behavior
  - **Safety Status**: Centralized safety condition monitoring and reporting
  - **Integration Panel**: Unified UI combining all Phase 7 widgets

## Integration

### Widget Registration
All Phase 7 widgets are registered in `src/widgets/__init__.py` with corresponding Qt Designer plugins for UI integration.

### LinuxCNC Integration Points
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time connection to LinuxCNC status for homing, limits, spindle state
- **Command Interface**: Integration points for homing commands, spindle control, limit overrides
- **HAL Compatibility**: Designed to work with LinuxCNC HAL pins and parameters
- **NGC Script Support**: Warmup sequences available as standalone NGC programs

### Safety Coordination
- **Pre-operation Checks**: Homing verification before jogging or program execution
- **Limit Management**: Automatic limit monitoring with override workflow
- **Maintenance Gating**: Critical maintenance can block program execution
- **Hours Tracking**: Integrated spindle hours across warmup and maintenance systems

## Testing & Simulation

### Test Suite (`test_phase7_widgets.py`)
- Widget import verification
- Instantiation testing without full LinuxCNC environment
- File structure validation
- NGC script format verification
- Acceptance criteria verification

### Demo Application (`phase7_demo.py`)
- Standalone demonstration of all Phase 7 features
- Tabbed interface for individual component testing
- Integrated safety panel demonstration
- Signal connection examples

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

✅ **Unhomed jog prompts homing dialog in sim:**
- `HomingManager.checkHomingRequired()` method provides this functionality
- Integration with jogging controls via `Phase7SafetyManager.checkJoggingAllowed()`

✅ **Soft-limit triggers prompt; bypass permits limited action; auto-reverts:**
- `LimitOverrideManager.monitorLimits()` detects limit triggers
- `LimitOverrideDialog` provides countdown confirmation workflow
- Time-boxed override with automatic revert via `checkOverrideExpiry()`

✅ **Warmup sequence runs; spindle-hours counter increments:**
- `SpindleWarmupDialog` executes configurable RPM ladder sequences
- `SpindleWarmupWidget.updateSpindleHours()` tracks runtime automatically
- Persistent JSON storage maintains hours across sessions

## Architecture Notes
