  "description": "Manual jogging controls for precise machine positioning. Move axes individually using continuous or incremental modes with adjustable speeds.",
  "usage": "Jogging operations:\n• Select axis to move (X, Y, Z, etc.)\n• Choose jog mode: continuous or incremental\n• Set jog speed using slider or presets\n• Use direction buttons or keyboard arrows\n• For incremental: select step size (0.001\" to 1.0\")\n• Use MPG wheel for fine positioning",
  "tips": [
    "Start with slow speeds for precise positioning",
    "Use incremental mode for exact distances", 
    "Continuous mode is faster for large movements",
    "Keyboard shortcuts: arrow keys for X/Y, Page Up/Down for Z",
    "Hold Shift for faster jog speeds",
    "MPG wheel provides tactile feedback for fine adjustments"
  ],
  "safety": [
    "Always check for obstructions before jogging",
    "Start with slow speeds until familiar with machine response",
    "Keep emergency stop within easy reach",
    "Be aware of soft and hard limits",
    "Never jog into fixtures, vises, or tooling",
    "Ensure machine is homed before jogging to absolute positions",
    "Watch for cable snags during movement"
